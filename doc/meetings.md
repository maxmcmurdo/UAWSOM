### Summary

This second ABCD meeting targets further code streamlining, adding functionality in both the physics
and the numerical algorithmic techniques. We also plan to discuss and initiate future collaborative efforts. 
We will dedicate attention to visualization and python post-processing, as well as to formulating long term code strategies.

### Summary

Eleven people from institutes in Belgium, China, Germany and The Netherlands
convened for the first AMRVAC meeting. This was a joint meeting of developers
working on MPI-AMRVAC and its sister code BHAC, which focuses on (general)
relativistic problems. The participants formed different *tiger teams*, to work
on topics such as CT (constrained transport) methods, the Boris
semi-relativistic approximation, visualization with
[yt](https://yt-project.org/) and fixing bugs. The meeting also included joint
sessions, in which for example long-term code development was discussed as well
as more technical topics, demos of certain functionality were presented, and
ideas were shared on future scientific applications. At the end of the meeting,
version 2.1 of MPI-AMRVAC was released.

We thank Nada Mitrovic for helping out with the meeting's organization.
