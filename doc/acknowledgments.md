This 3.0 version of the MPI-AMRVAC software was released in November 2022, with the aid of Beatrice Popescu Braileanu, Niels Claes and various core contributors (Chun Xia, Guo Yang, Yuhao Zhou, Wenzhi Ruan, Fabio Bacchini). 
The team effort is managed by 
[Rony Keppens](http://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541) at
the
[Centre for mathematical Plasma-Astrophysics (CmPA)](https://wis.kuleuven.be/CmPA) at
KU Leuven. The code has some heritage (in the solver part) to
the [Versatile Advection Code ](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gtoth) or VAC,
initiated by Gabor Toth at the Astronomical Institute at Utrecht in November
1994, with help from Rony Keppens since 1996.

* **Beatrice Popescu Braileanu** as a core developer
* **Yuhao Zhou** as a core developer
* **Niels Claes** as a core developer
* **Guo Yang** as a core developer
* **Wenzhi Ruan** as a core developer
* **Fabio Bacchini** as a core developer
* **Rony Keppens** as a core developer
* **Veronika Jercic** 
* **Joris Hermans** 
* **Nicolas Moens** 
* **Florian Driessen**

Past contributors to MPI-AMRVAC are:

* **Zakaria Meliani** as core developer (relativistic physics modules,
  parallel I/O, postprocessing formats) 
* **Oliver Porth** as core developer, leading the MPI-AMRVAC 1.0 release
* **Jannis Teunissen** realized a major restructuring to MPI-AMRVAC 2.2
* **Bart Ripperda** (particle module)
* **Allard Jan van Marle** (optically thin radiative loss treatments)
* **Ileyk El Mellah** (radial grid stretching)
* **Clement Robert** (yt frontend)

* A number of users at CmPA and abroad
